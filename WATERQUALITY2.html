  <h3 style="font-size: 45";><center>Water quality refers to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water based on the standards of its usage. It is  most frequently used by reference to a set of standards against which compliance, generally achieved through treatment of the water, can be assessed. The most     common standards used to monitor and assess water quality convey the health of ecosystems, safety of human contact, extend of water pollution and condition of     drinking water. Water quality has a significant impact on water supply and oftentimes determines supply options.</h3>
